## Frontend Coding Thanks

### Introduction
<br>
Imagine you own a rental business like Roadsurfer :) You have a bunch of campervans
and rental stations across the globe. Your customers pick up and return campervans at
your stations. Your station personnel are kept busy handing over and processing the
returned vans. To make your station staff‚Äôs lives easier, their work more efficient, and
to improve transparency between all departments, you decide to create a calendar-like
dashboard web-app, which based on the existing bookings displays all planned
pickups (booking start date) and returns (booking end date) of campervans at every
station. For the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs agree that a booking should be returned to the
same station where it was picked up.

### Setup
- Use a framework of your choice (Vue.js, Angular, React). If you not sure which,
choose vue.js
- Please take care of some simple (or sophisticated - it is up to you üòâ) styling
(recommended, but not required, would be to use tailwindcss)
- Host your code in github and publish your web-app on a Github Pages
https://pages.github.com/
- In terms of the UX, the freedom is all yours: if the explanation below is not
explicit enough, just come up with your own UX
- Layout of your web-app should be designed keeping the ‚Äúmobile first design‚Äù
principle in mind

<br>

### ToDo
- Create a reusable component ‚Äúautocomplete‚Äù: a field with an autocomplete
function
  - While the user types in the field, the remote api is queried to perform a
search based on the text entered
  - After the user has clicked on one of the suggested results, the value is
selected and an event to notify any interested handlers is triggered
- On a responsive grid create mobile and desktop views for the following page:
  - A week view (UX / UI is up to you)
    - Calendar-like week view (7 tiles, one for each week day)
    - Pagination to switch weeks
    - Station selector: reuse your component ‚Äúautocomplete‚Äù, for
choosing a station (a station where the booking starts or ends).
The source data of stations can be queried here:
https://605c94c36d85de00170da8b4.mockapi.io/stations
    - On every day-tile display bookings that start or end on that
given day at the selected station
    - When a booking is clicked, a new view with booking details is
opened (see ‚ÄúA booking detail view‚Äù)
    - <b>Optional</b>: A station employee can reschedule the pickup or
return day of the booking by drag-and-dropping them (you can
store the changes locally + emulate an api call - output the
imaginary api call as text to the console)
  - A booking detail view (UX / UI is up to you)
    - Booking information can be retrieved here:
https://605c94c36d85de00170da8b4.mockapi.io/stations/{station-id}/bookings/{booking-id}
    - Display booking details:
      - Customer name
      - Booking Start Date
      - Booking End Date
      - Booking Duration
      - Pickup-Return Station Name
    - Action to return to the calendar view
- <b>Optional</b>: Introduce i.e. demonstrate a state management in your application (it
is up to you to choose the level of complexity of the state management and in
what part of the application you use it
